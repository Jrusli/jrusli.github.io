          Scotty Ninh is a videographer focused mainly on cinematography and color grading.
        </p>
        <p className="about-description">
          He started out making short video game compilations and stop motion animations, but as grew up with the rise of social media and the content creation sphere, he branched off into more real time filming and found himself to enjoy the process of creating a scene from scratch.
        </p>
        <p className="about-description">
          As a result of (essentially) being raised online, he pulls much of his inspiration through music videos, fashion spec ads, and even YouTube vlogs. More recently, he has been exploring more abstract concepts with the use of cables, old technology, and eerily vacant spaces.
        </p>
        <p className="about-description">
          Much of his most recent work has been with his personal YouTube channel and student news organization, The Poly Post as he created documentary, journalism, and video essay styled videos. He even was able to pick up several awards from collegiate and state journalism events.
        </p>
        <p className="about-description">
          Currently he is looking into exploring the world of freelance commercial work with his recent graduation as Magna Cum Laude at Cal Poly Pomona, and is looking to further refine his style as he grows alongside his clients.
